# Youtube-Steam-Analysis
This repository contains a project for the course DSA210 at Sabanci University. It explores the relationship between gaming activity on Steam and YouTube watch history. The primary goal is to investigate whether there is a significant correlation between the periods when a game is actively played and when related content is consumed on YouTube.
